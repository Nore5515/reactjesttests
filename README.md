# React Jest Tests
This project is a simple react (js) app that reads from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com for some sample data, and it's purpose is to help me familiarize myself with react's fetch systems and jest's asynch testing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
